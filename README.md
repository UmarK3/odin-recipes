# odin-recipes

This project showcases the HTML and Git skills I've picked up during TOP.It's a basic recipe website. There's a main homepage which includes links to a few different recipes. The site isn't particularly pretty to look at yet as I've not had a chance to return to it and apply some CSS to give it a bit of style.
