# odin-recipes

This project is an application of the HTML and Git skills that I've aquired during TOP.

This is a basic recipe website. There is a main home page (index.html) which has links to a few different recipes, the website isn't be particularly nice to look at yet until I return to it and with some CSS skills in order to give it style.
