    <h2><em>Lamb Shank Nihari</em></h2>
    <p>Nihari is a rich, slow-cooked meat stew that is a hallmark of the Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, 
    specifically tracing its origins back to 18th-century Delhi and Lucknow. The word itself comes from the Arabic word 'Nahar' (نهار), meaning morning, reflecting its original function: 
    a hearty, high-energy morning meal. Traditionally, it was prepared overnight and eaten by Muslim noblemen after the morning prayer (Fajr), often followed by a nap until the mid-day prayer. 
    Over time, it also became a staple for working-class labourers, who relied on the nutrient-dense dish, to sustain them through long, cold days. 
    Today, Nihari is revered as a celebratory dish, particularly during Eid (much like Biryani), and is cherished for its depth of flavour, velvety-thick gravy, and meltingly tender meat, often served with warm, pillowy naan.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Prepare the Masala</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Toast whole spices -</strong> gently toast fennel seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cloves, green cardamom, star anise and bay leaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Grind -</strong> after 2 minutes grind the spices into a fine powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix -</strong> combine the spice blend with red chilli powder, tumeric powder and salt.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Part 2: Sear the Meat</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Brown Shanks -</strong> heat the oil over medium-heat and place lamb shanks until nicely brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Saute Onions -</strong> within the same pot add sliced onions and fry for about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Aromatics -</strong> stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bloom Spices - </strong> add the prepared masala to the pot and fry the spice for 1-2 minutes. Add water to prevent burning.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Part 3: Slow Cook</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add Meat and water -</strong> return lamb shanks to the pot and add water to cover the shanks, bring to a boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer -</strong> once boiling, reduce to lowest heat and cover pot with a lid.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook for Tenderness -</strong> simmer for 3-4 hours until meat is tender; falling off the bone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Part 4: Thicken and Finish</h4>

        <li><strong>Prepare slurry -</strong> once meat is tender mix plain flour with cup of cold water to form a paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken Gravy -</strong> slowly pour slurry into the Nihari and stir consistently. Allow the stew to simmer for another 10-15 minutes until gravy is thickened.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Part 5: Garnish and Serve</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Serve -</strong> ladle the hot nihari, ensuring each bowl has a lamb shank and plenty of gravy.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish -</strong> Sprinkle ginger, chopped gree chillies, corriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong> with naan, tandoori roti or even plain rice.</li>
