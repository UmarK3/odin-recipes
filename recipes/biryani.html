    <h2><em>Chicken Biryani</em></h2>
    <p>Biryani is an iconic, mixed rice dish layered with marinated meat (such as chicken, mutton, or beef) or vegetables, and slow-cooked in a sealed pot
    with a rich medley of whole and ground spices, saffron, and fresh herbs like mint and cilantro. Its cultural significance traces back to the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire, where it is believed to have developed from Persian pilaf by fusing it with native Indian spices and cooking techniques. 
    Biryani is universally recognized as a celebration dish, typically served at weddings and festivals like Eid
